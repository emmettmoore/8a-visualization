<h1>Interesting Cases to Consider in Report</h1>

<h2>Outlying Climbs</h2>

<h3>When Grades Change</h3>

<ul>
<li>Blue-Eyed-Honkey Jesus, listed as 7b+ at the Red River Gorge, has 112 "fair", 85 "soft", and 3 "hard" ascents out of a sample of 200 users. At 42.5%, this climb holds one of the highest percentages of soft attributions in the Red, so we went to investigate what might be the problem. 
<ul>
<li>As it turns out, it appears that it was downgraded from 7b+ to 7b in some people's eyes at one point, therefore making people log a lower grade in their log books. </li>
<li>One user, who logged the route as a fair 7b+, argued that Blue Eyed Honkey Jesus is  "Too hard to be [7b] with the easy Supafly sitting next door at [7a+]." Supafly, however, has a very high percentage of soft ascents as well (23%). One possible conclusion here, then, is that grades are judged relative to their neighbors. Since Supfly is supposed to be a soft 7a+, and Blue Eyed Honkey Jesus is 2 grades harder, then it would be unfair to call Blue Eyed Honkey Jesus a 7b.</li>
